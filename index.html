            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>This work investigates the integration of eccentric nanoshells into thin-film silicon (Si) solar cells to enhance optical absorption. The nanoshells function simultaneously as light-trapping elements and intrinsic absorbers. An analytical scattering model, based on a progressive matrix formulation combined with multipole expansion, is used to obtain rigorous electromagnetic solutions, while finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations provide full-wave evaluation of the device response. The results show that the inner-cavity radius and the eccentric displacement strongly influence the scattering strength and the spectral locations of the dominant resonant modes. The optimized design, featuring an outer shell radius of 350 nm and a cavity displaced opposite to the incident direction, achieves an integrated absorption of 77.93% over the 300–1100 nm range. The corresponding electric-field profiles confirm that the eccentric geometry enhances field confinement within the nanoshell and efficiently channels optical energy into the underlying Si substrate, thereby improving carrier-generation potential. These findings highlight eccentric nanoshells as a promising structural platform for high-performance and cost-effective ultrathin Si solar cells.</p>

            <h3>Introduction Domain</h3>
            <p>Solar cells are a promising technology for renewable energy conversion, and their efficiency depends on how much sunlight is absorbed and converted into electricity. However, mainstream photovoltaic technologies still face challenges such as optical losses, high material consumption, and high manufacturing cost, all of which limit large-scale deployment and further efficiency improvement. Conventional Si solar cells require thick absorption layers, typically on the order of hundreds of micrometers, to capture most above-bandgap photons1. This increases material usage and restricts applications that require flexible devices. Thin-film solar cells reduce absorber thickness to a few micrometers or less, which lowers material cost and enables lightweight designs2. However, ultrathin absorbers suffer from short optical path lengths, which reduce absorption, especially at longer wavelengths, and create a major bottleneck for efficiency3–5. These challenges motivate the development of effective light-trapping strategies.</p>

            <h2 id="part-7-introduction-topic">Part 7 - Introduction Topic</h2>
            <h3>Introduction Topic</h3>
            <p>Various micro- and nanostructured designs have been explored to enhance light absorption of solar cells6–8. Surface pyramidal textures reduce reflectivity and promote multiple reflections at the Si interface, making them widely applied in crystalline Si cells9,10. Grating structures scatter and diffract light into waveguide modes, extending the photon path length and improving absorption in the visible and infrared11–13. Other structures, including nanowires, nanocones, and nanoholes, have demonstrated strong absorption improvements by supporting resonant modes and efficient light confinement14–16. These strategies offer broadband light-trapping capabilities, though challenges remain in fabrication complexity, stability, and integration with ultrathin devices.</p>

            <h2 id="part-8-introduction-recent">Part 8 - Introduction Recent</h2>
            <h3>Introduction Recent</h3>
            <p>Recent studies have extended nanoparticle geometries beyond simple solid spheres. Yao et al. proposed a broadband light-management strategy by employing Si nanoshell structures, in which whispering-gallery-mode resonances are excited23. A monolayer of nanoshells produced absorption equivalent to a planar film more than ten times thicker, demonstrating that nanoshell geometries can provide dramatic material savings and broadband enhancement. Shameli et al. investigated distributed Si nanoparticles embedded in thin-film architectures and showed that such configurations can significantly increase photocurrent under different polarizations24. Mirnaziry et al. analyzed multilayered Si nanoparticle absorbers, finding that stacking layers further improved absorption at longer wavelengths and provided robustness against variations in incident angle25. Together, these works highlight the potential of complex nanoparticle geometries to enhance absorption in ultrathin solar cells.</p>

            <h2 id="part-9-introduction-novelty">Part 9 - Introduction Novelty</h2>
            <h3>Introduction Novelty</h3>
            <p>Building on these advances, we propose a systematic evolution of the Si nanoparticle design: from the conventional solid nanosphere to concentric hollow shells and finally to eccentric nanoshells. Compared with solid nanoparticles, hollow nanoshells offer enhanced tunability of multipolar resonances, especially facilitating the excitation of higher-order modes for stronger and more flexible light–matter interactions. Furthermore, eccentric displacement of the cavity introduces an additional tuning parameter, enabling more flexible and precise control over multipolar resonances. To rigorously evaluate these evolving designs, we employ a dual-modeling framework. A progressive matrix combined with a multipole expansion formalism is used to obtain analytical scattering solutions and reveal the modal origin of resonance tunability. Full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations are then performed to assess device-level absorption when nanoshell arrays are integrated into thin-film Si substrates. Through this combined approach, we demonstrate that eccentric nanoshells can simultaneously function as effective light-trapping structures and intrinsic absorbers. Systematic optimization of cavity radius and displacement leads to substantially enhanced broadband absorption and higher theoretical photocurrent density compared with planar and concentric-shell counterparts. These results establish eccentric nanoshells as a versatile nanophotonic platform that enables stronger light confinement, improved energy coupling into the active layer, and promising potential for high-efficiency, low-cost ultrathin Si photovoltaics.</p>

            <h2 id="part-10-theory">Part 10 - Theory</h2>
            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <p>Eccentric nanoshells represent a class of nanostructures in which the inner core is displaced from the center of the outer shell. Such a structural asymmetry has been demonstrated to induce strong absorption and efficient light concentration, as reported in earlier studies26. In this work, we focus on the simplest eccentric configuration, namely a two-layer eccentric nanoshell, as shown in Fig. 1. The inner core has a radius  , while the outer shell has an outer radius  . The displacement of the core center relative to the shell center is denoted by  . To obtain the analytical solution of light scattered by this eccentric nanoshell, we start from the general progressive-matrix formulation previously developed for multilayered spherical systems27. By specializing this formalism to the two-layer eccentric case, the governing equations can be simplified into compact expressions. This derivation provides a rigorous analytical solution, which will serve as the foundation for the subsequent theoretical analysis and numerical studies presented in this paper.</p>
            <p>The electromagnetic fields in the nanoshell follow the Helmholtz-type Maxwell equations:</p>
            <pre><code>∇²E + k²E = 0,  ∇·E = 0,  H = -(i/ω)∇×E,  k = ωn/c</code></pre>

            <h2 id="part-11-result-1">Part 11 - Result 1</h2>
            <h3>Result 1</h3>
            <p>Before conducting electromagnetic simulations of the entire nanostructured solar cell, which includes both the planar Si layer and eccentric nanoshells, analysis of the scattering responses of nanoparticles with various material compositions and radii was conducted. The analytical solution enables accurate computation of total scattering efficiency as well as the contributions of different scattering modes (e.g., electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, magnetic quadrupole). Compared to the FDTD method, the analytical approach shows higher computational efficiency for single-particle analysis, which facilitates the initial identification of structural configurations with strong modal response, and provides physical insights and guiding the optimization of subsequent FDTD simulations and device design. Therefore, the investigation begins with the simplest case of a solid Si sphere, followed by the introduction of structural cavities at different locations to evaluate their impact on both the scattering intensity and the modal composition.</p>
            <p>Fig. 3 illustrates the scattering behavior and multipolar modal distribution of solid Si nanoparticles with varying radius. Figure 3a shows the results for a Si particle with a radius of 100 nm, including the total scattering efficiency and the contribution from different multipolar modes. In this figure, a1, a2, and a3 represent the contribution from the electric dipole, electric quadrupole, and electric octupole modes respectively while b1, b2, and b3 correspond to the magnetic dipole, magnetic quadrupole, and magnetic octupole modes. Higher-order modes contributed negligibly to the spectral range considered and were thus omitted from the plot. The results demonstrate that the scattering response is primarily governed by the electric and magnetic dipole modes, with the peak of the magnetic dipole appearing at a longer wavelength. This shift is attributed to the unique behavior of high-refractive-index Si particles, where the magnetic dipole is excited by circulating displacement currents. These currents exhibit a longer oscillation period compared to that of electric dipole mode. Therefore, the resonance peak of the magnetic dipole shifts to longer wavelengths. Fig. 3(b) shows the scattering response of a Si particle with an increased radius of 200 nm. Compared to the 100 nm particle, the overall scattering remains dominated by the electric and magnetic dipole modes. However, both resonances exhibited a noticeable redshift toward longer wavelengths. This shift is due to the longer spatial period of the electromagnetic modes associated with the larger particle size. To further demonstrate this size-dependent behavior, Fig. 3(c) illustrates the evolution of the peak wavelengths of the electric and magnetic dipole modes as the particle radius increases from 100 nm to 200 nm. The results clearly show that both modes experience gradual shifts towards longer wavelengths with increasing size. For instance, the electric dipole peak shifts from around 650 nm to 1100 nm, while the magnetic dipole peak shifts from around 750 nm to 1500 nm, respectively. In summary, the results in Fig. 3(a-c) indicate that adjusting the radius of solid Si nanoparticles provides an effective strategy for controlling both scattering intensity and the spectral position of dominant optical modes. This tunability allows for precise spectral selectivity and offers a flexible design parameter for further structural optimization.</p>
            <p>Compared to solid Si nanoparticles, hollow nanostructures (Si shell with air core) are more effective to the excitation of higher-order multipolar modes. Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 3(e) show the scattering behavior and modal contributions for particles with a fixed outer diameter of 200 nm and inner cavity radius of 60 nm and 180 nm, respectively. A comparison between the two reveals that as the cavity size increases, the resonant intensities of the lower-order modes, such as the electric dipole (a₁) and magnetic dipole (b₁) decrease, while higher-order modes, particularly the magnetic octopole mode (b₃), become significantly stronger. To further analyze this trend, Fig. 3(f) plots the peak intensities of the electric and magnetic octupole modes as the cavity radius increases from 60 nm to 180 nm. As can be seen, with the increase of cavity size, the peak intensities of these two modes continue to rise, indicating that the thinner the shell, the more favorable it is for the excitation of higher-order modes. This is because higher-order modes require stronger local field gradients, and hollow structures provide sufficient spatial freedom to support complex current loops and multipolar field distributions. It is also worth noting that the spectral positions of these higher-order resonances exhibit a shift towards shorter wavelengths with increasing cavity size, which results from the reduction in effective resonant path length as the shell becomes thinner, leading to an increase in oscillating frequency.  Overall, the results in Fig. 3(d-f) demonstrate that by adjusting the relative dimensions of the internal air cavity and Si shell in hollow nanoshell structures, the excitation and spectral positioning of high-order optical modes can be effectively tuned. This tunability provides enhanced design flexibility for achieving multimodal light-matter coupling.</p>

            <p>After analyzing the influence of cavity size on modal behavior, we further investigated how cavity eccentricity shifts the scattering response of Si nanoshell structures. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the mode contributions to the scattering efficiency of the concentric reference case. In this configuration, the magnetic dipole (b₁) and magnetic quadrupole (b₂) show clear and pronounced peaks, indicating strong magnetic-mode excitation in the concentric Si nanoshell. In contrast, the electric dipole (a₁) exhibits a much flatter and weaker peak. This is mainly because introducing a central air cavity reduces the effective electric-field confinement inside the particle. The lower refractive-index core weakens the polarization strength that can build up along a single axis, making the electric dipole mode less efficiently excited compared to the magnetic modes.</p>
            <p>Figs. 4(b–d) then present the evolution of these modal components as the cavity offset varies systematically from +30 nm to –30 nm, with positive values indicating displacement opposite the incidence direction as defined in Fig. 2(b). In this work, displacement toward the incidence direction is referred to as the forward-eccentric (FE) configuration, while displacement opposite to the incidence direction is referred to as the backward-eccentric (BE) configuration. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the electric dipole contribution a₁ decreases monotonically as the cavity moves from +30 nm toward –30 nm. As the cavity shifts along the direction of light incidence, the upper Si region becomes thicker, allowing stronger charge oscillations and effectively boosting the electric dipole response in that region. As the cavity continues to shift toward the bottom, the local Si thickness above the cavity is reduced, weakening the available oscillation channel and weakening a₁. In contrast, the magnetic dipole contributions b₁ and b₂ exhibit an opposite trend, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d). As the cavity moves opposite to the incident light, the incident field first passes through the low-index cavity region, leading to repeated scattering between the cavity boundary and the surrounding Si shell. This configuration promotes circulating displacement currents, which enhances the magnetic dipole and higher-order magnetic components. The opposite happens for positive offset, where the thicker Si region encountered first by the incident field suppresses circular current pathways and weakens b₁ and b₂.</p>
            <p>Overall, the modal evolution in Fig. 4(b–d) demonstrates that cavity eccentricity provides a systematic means of tuning multipolar resonances. Electric-type modes are strengthened when the cavity is shifted toward the incidence direction, whereas magnetic-type modes are enhanced when the cavity is shifted away from the incidence direction. This tunability is achieved without altering the outer geometric dimensions of the nanoshell, thereby enabling fine control over both modal intensity and spectral position. Such eccentric nanoshells offer an additional degree of freedom for enhancing the coupling of incident light into underlying bottom layers.</p>

            <h3>Result 3</h3>
            <p>In the previous section, the regulatory mechanism of shell thickness, air cavity radius and cavity offset on multipolar mode response in Si nanoshell particles was revealed through analytical scattering theory. Based on this analysis, FDTD optical simulations on full thin-film solar cells containing eccentric nanoshell structures and a bottom Si substrate were further conducted, in order to evaluate how different structural configurations enhance overall absorption performance. Fig. 5 presents the total integrated absorption of solar cells over 300 to 1100 nm wavelength range for various combinations of structural parameters. Fig. 5(a), (b), (c), and (d) correspond to outer shell radius of 150 nm, 250 nm, 350 nm, 450 nm respectively. In each figure of the four cases, the horizontal and vertical axes represent the cavity radius and the cavity offset distance, respectively.</p>
            <p>From the comparison of Fig. 5(a-d), it can be observed that the integrated absorption reaches the highest value of 78% when the Si shell radius is 350 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(c). As the shell radius is too small, modal excitation is insufficient and absorption is weak. When the shell radius is too large, the resonant modes shift into the far-infrared region and no longer effectively overlap with the solar spectrum. A radius of 350 nm provides a balanced configuration that supports the excitation of higher-order magnetic modes, enhances local optical field confinement and efficiently couples energy into the bottom substrate.</p>
            <p>By comparing the parameter distributions in Fig. 5, it can see that as the cavity radius increases, the overall absorption first increases and then falls, indicating a clear optimal value. This trend agrees with the analytical results in Fig. 3(d-f), where the introduction of a cavity allows effective excitation of higher-order modes, thus enhancing the device's response to broadband incident light. However, when the cavity becomes too large and the shell too thin, the spatial support for higher-order modes reduces and lower-order modes also become difficult to form, leading to decreased absorption performance. Hence, there exists an optimal range for the cavity radius. In each plot of Fig. 5, structures with BE cavities generally perform better than both concentric and FE structures. Compared to concentric structures, FE configurations are more likely to excite electric dipole modes, which concentrate energy in the bulk Si region. However, since the cavity is located beneath the light propagation path, this concentrated energy is more easily reflected back into the air and is difficult to couple effectively into the substrate. In contrast, BE configurations favor magnetic mode excitation. The concentrated energy is also located within the lower Si region, allowing the energy to be more readily guided into the bottom Si layer.</p>

            <h3>Result 4</h3>
            <p>Fig. 6 illustrates the absorption spectra of a solar cell consisting of a flat substrate integrated with various structures, solid nanoparticles (denoted as Solid), concentric nanoshells (denoted as Con), forward-eccentric nanoshells (denoted as FE), and backward-eccentric nanoshells (denoted as BE). For the solid nanoparticle, the particle outer radius is 350 nm.</p>
            <p>For the concentric nanoshell, the structure has an outer shell radius of 350 nm and an inner cavity radius of 210 nm. Both the FE and BE configurations use the same outer and inner radii as the concentric nanoshell, with the cavity shifted by 140 nm along the incident direction in the FE case and by 210 nm opposite to the incident direction in the BE case. Fig. 7 presents the corresponding electric field distributions at a representative wavelength for the solid particle, hollow concentric nanoshell, forward-eccentric nanoshell, and backward-eccentric nanoshell configurations. The results show that the reference flat cell exhibits relatively low overall absorption, indicating limited light coupling efficiency in the absence of structural modulation. After incorporating solid Si nanoparticles (case Solid), the absorption increases markedly from 23.62% to 61.61%. This improvement can be attributed to the additional scattering layer formed by the nanoparticles which extends the optical path of incident light. The Si particles also support resonance modes that facilitate partial light trapping within the active region and thereby enhance the overall absorption efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7(a), light is concentrated inside the solid particle where absorption occurs, and a narrow portion of light further propagates into the substrate. After introducing the hollow concentric Si nanoshells (case Con), the overall integral absorption reaches 59.67%. Its performance is approximately comparable to that of the solid Si particle. This phenomenon arises from two competing factors. On one hand, the hollow structure has a smaller effective absorbing volume than the solid configuration, leading to a theoretically lower absorption. On the other hand, the hollow geometry facilitates the tuning of resonance modes and enhances forward scattering to some extent. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the field intensity is mainly distributed within the nanoshell layer while the inner cavity remains field-free, and a broader portion of light is coupled into the underlying substrate. As a result, the overall absorption becomes comparable to that of the solid counterpart.</p>
            <p>When the cavity is displaced along the incident direction (case FE), the integral absorption decreases to 56.50%, indicating no improvement relative to the concentric configuration. This reduction can be attributed to the confinement of resonant modes in the upper region of the particle, while the lower cavity impedes effective optical coupling into the substrate, as evidenced by the electric field distribution presented in Fig. 7(c). When the cavity is displaced opposite to the incident direction (case BE), the overall integral absorption increases to 77.93%, showing a significant enhancement compared with the forward-eccentric configuration. This improvement originates from the strengthened excitation of magnetic modes and the concentration of optical energy closer to the substrate, which promotes efficient light coupling into the bottom active layer and thereby improves absorption efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the electromagnetic field is strongly confined within the particle, indicating effective trapping and absorption, while a substantial portion of light is further guided and absorbed within the underlying substrate. In summary, the direction of cavity offset not only influences the excitation of distinct optical modes but also governs the spatial distribution and coupling efficiency of energy within the structure.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This study demonstrates that eccentric nanoshells can simultaneously act as light-trapping elements and intrinsic absorbers in thin-film Si solar cells. Analytical modeling and FDTD simulations confirm that cavity radius and eccentric displacement control multipolar resonances and enhance energy coupling into the active layer. The optimized configuration, with a ~350 nm shell radius and upward offset, achieves broadband absorption around 77.93% across 300 to 1100 nm and significantly improves photocurrent compared with planar cells. These findings establish eccentric nanoshells as a multifunctional nanophotonic platform and highlight their potential for efficient, low-cost ultrathin photovoltaics. Future work should extend this concept to alternative materials and scalable fabrication approaches.</p>

            <p>November 21, 2025</p>
            <p>Dear Editor:</p>
            <p>Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled "Computational Electromagnetic Multiple Scattering of Multilayered Core–Shell Nanoparticles Using a Progressive Algorithm," which we respectfully submit for consideration for publication in the Journal of Lightwave Technology.</p>
            <p>This work presents a generalized computational framework for electromagnetic multiple scattering involving multilayered concentric nanoshells and their aggregates. Building upon our recently developed progressive algorithm, this study establishes an analytical and computationally efficient methodology that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Computes the scattering coefficients of multilayered core–shell nanoparticles without requiring recursive procedures, significantly reducing the computational load compared to widely used recursive algorithms.</li>
                <li>Integrates the progressive algorithm with the vector addition theorem and the Wagner small d-matrix, enabling accurate modeling of electromagnetic interactions within nanoparticle clusters.</li>
                <li>Decomposes the total scattering efficiency of a cluster into individual-particle contributions and inter-particle modal interactions, providing new physical insight into directional scattering control.</li>
                <li>Demonstrates, through a series of validated case studies, that the proposed method achieves excellent agreement with experimental measurements, while offering substantial improvements in computational efficiency.</li>
                <li>Reveals tunable forward-scattering and lateral-scattering behaviors in multilayered nanoparticle clusters by adjusting layer radii, inter-particle gaps, and particle alignment—providing valuable guidelines for designing nanophotonic structures for light-energy harvesting, optical communication, and scattering-based devices.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The manuscript offers a generalized, efficient, and physically interpretable computational approach that addresses challenges in multilayered nanoparticle scattering modeling. The results are directly relevant to the photonics and nanophotonics communities, especially researchers focusing on light–matter interaction, scattering engineering, and optical device design.</p>
            <p>We believe the presented methodology and physical insights fit well within the scope of Journal of Lightwave Technology, and we would be grateful if the manuscript could be considered for publication.</p>
